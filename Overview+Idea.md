> "Ben, we need to talk." said Kevin.  
> Ben was confused. "Er, whats up, Kevin?"  
> "There is something I need to tell you, it's important."  
> "Okay then lead the way." went Ben scratching his hair.  
> Kevin went in to one of the smaller conference rooms - it actually was the smallest a former buro. Ben's godfather saw them from one of the libraries and followed them. Ben and Kevin each took a seat faceing each other. The setting sun giving Bens brown hair an auburn appearance and accenting the frecles.  
> 'Sweet mama. He's obnoxius <u>and</u> cute. Here goes nothing.'  
> Before he could say any word the godfather appeared in the door frame.  
> "Is that going to be a tea or a spirit situation?"  
> "Tea - but I think he will need a spirit later.", Kevin said mischieviously makeing Ben look nervous.  
> The man nodded and left. The offer came to the right time. Somehow this had pounded the habit into his head that whenever or for whatever tea was offered (and that offer taken up) no serious talking would happen until tea was served. For the five minutes or so it took the man to brew the tea they sat exchangeing small talk - both of them squabbeling for their absymal skills. Soon the taps of his feet came close and he entered with a tray and placed a teapot on a heater, a bowl with rock sugar and two cups on the desk.  
> "I hope you can talk it out - what ever it is." said Ben's godfather and left.  
> They put candy in their cups, filled them up with tea. And while Ben took a moment to breathe in the aroma of the tea Kevin wanted to take a sip from the still steaming tea promptly burning his tongue. His startled reaction elicted a chuckle from Ben.  
> 'Crap, why do I alway fall for the annoying ones?' wondered Kevin.  
> After takeing a sniff from the tea he recocnonzed something and asked Ben: "Have I ever had this tea?"  
> "Yep. He calls this blend "HospitaliTea"."  
> Kevin winced.  
> "I know his puns are the worst." said Ben while smiling inhaling the smell of this tea.  
> Kevin put his cup down. 'Quick and painless, like a Band-Aid.'  
> "So, I wnated to tell you something", he began.  
> Ben just did that odd humming noise.  
> "I don't know if you noticed but ther have been some changes between us."  
>  "Huh."  
> "And you know that I really like you as a friend."  
> "Why do I sense a but coming?"  
> "Not but, more an 'yet'?"  
> Lifting his eyebrow Ben said:"So what?"  
> "Okay, Tennyson that's gonna sound wierd but there ahve been a thing or two I can't out of my mind?"  
> $\vdots$  
> Kevin had enough of talking he went to action. Somewhere in his mind he knew he overstepped but he would care later right now he grabbed Ben by the collar of his sweater pulled and kissed Ben. Not hard - hesitant but willful. He felt the surprise running through Ben's body and was then surprised himself as Ben cautiously returned the kiss.  
> "Benjamin Kirby Tennyson, what on earth are you$\dots$ ?!"  
> Every thing came to standstill as both recognized the voice. And the one that followed.  
> "Ah, Gwen. I was looking for you. It seem son of the introductory tomes of eastern european mythology has vanished. Might happen to be in your place? I surely $\dots$"  
> As the door closed and locked itself the voice of Benjamins godfather faded.  
> 'What a wierd house' Kevin thought to himself. He let got and both of them sat down again.  
> "So, Kirby, is middle name? I always thought it was 'Brash'."  
> Ben's face switched between offensed and confused - which was infuriatingly cute.  
>
